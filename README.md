# Music Merge Project

Music merge generates playlists,from one artist to another "target" artist, given a fixed number of steps.
The problem is directed streaming, rather than just playing similar artists to the previous like most streaming / playlist generation services. An "artist" vector space via an autoencoder.

This project uses the spotify API to acquire data & Keras for machine learning.

### Examples
Examples of the algorithm are on my youtube. Use cases can vary from similar artists, to very different (change the vibe up gradually).
